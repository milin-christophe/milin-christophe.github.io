title: About me
subtitle: Expert in energy efficiency financing
---

My name is Christophe MILIN. I currently work as Project Advisor at the Executive Agency for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (EASME) in Brussels.

Over the years, I've developed strong analytical and summarizing skills. Facing a variety of situations in France and abroad, I've demonstrated my flexibility and adaptability. I've also shown a capacity to understand the needs and expectations of diverse actors, at different levels of territory and governance (from municipalities to ministries and multilateral institutions).

Either as Consultant or as Client, I've covered the entire life-cycle of a large number of projects and developed a fairly good understanding of the possible difficulties and pitfalls. I'm capable of developing complex methodologies and managing large transnational projects involving contributors with diverse backgrounds.

Though I've worked on a broader thematic scope (from energy and GHG statistical and forecast analysis to the definition and implementation of energy and climate action plans, including ex-post programme evaluation), I became an expert in energy efficiency services and financing of energy efficiency. Working largely with public bodies, I've been involved in a number of initiatives aiming at enhancing cooperation between public and private sectors and leveraging private funding.

I've developed good written and oral skills, as well as a capacity for argumentation, negotiation and networking.
